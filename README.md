## ***Eat smarter with Elimin8.***

Elimin8 is a personal food-symptom tracking app [specifically for individuals who suffer from autoimmune skin disorders]. Autoimmune diseases are often associated with intestinal permeability also known as leaky gut syndrome. Making the right food choices can make a world of a difference in clearing up the skin. By tracking your diet, identify which foods cause flare-ups and create a master list of symptom-causing foods personalized to you. Elimin8 can aid you in taking back control of your body by targeting the root problem and understanding the connection between your mind, gut, diet, and well-being.

**Coming to the Google Play Store in the near future!**
